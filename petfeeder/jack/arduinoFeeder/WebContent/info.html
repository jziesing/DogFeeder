                <h4>The first software we worte was pretty basic.  Having no experience with an Arduino Yun, but some experience with an Aduino was interesting and required a few days to adapt.  We first dug into the Arduino's libraries and used a server package that handled all the requests directly with the user.  This was quickly proven to be inaffective when trying to get and post mid to larger sized pieces of data.  This issue led us to discover the full use of the Yun's linux processor, which has an OpenWrt image on it.  The First software we ended up writing for a basic feed command used a basic javascript page that posted, a tomcat servlet, and an Arduino 'sketch' that executed get's on the server and moved the servo accordingly. </h4>

We tried a few different things both design oriented and programming oriented, but in the end we found making the auger narrower and changing the area where food enters the auger was most effec </h4>

                <h4>This was tricky to make and could be made a lot better.  Using wood for this is not ideal.  I think in the future I would design some 3d files to print to make the design nicer and more effective.  It does work however and proves the concept. </h4>

                <h4>When we set out to add audio communication to the feeder we quickly learned that a video chat like feature would be very difficult and possibly not possible.  We then tried to add sending recorded messages to the feeder, and got fairly far, but failed in the end.  The issue was sending the video file.  We only tried on a tomcat server, which may be prohibiting us.  Nevertheless I feel this feature is worth revisiting.  We did think about adding some pre loaded sounds to play for your dog but found it sill when testing. </h4>

It turned out that we ran into trouble using wifi when implementing the webcam stream.  In order to do so we needed reconfigure our wifi to get our own ip.  This is doable, but but for convience we decided to go with an ethernet connection, especially since things are already pretty complicated using the schools wifi.</h4>

We also had a tomcat server running.  This communicated with the arduino, which ended up having a bit of code on it. The Arduino turned out to be sketch code (.ino) and terminal commands, and we tried to do as much work on our server to keep better performance from the Arduino.  </h4>
